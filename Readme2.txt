This is william's first line
No more be grieved at that which thou hast done:
Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud:
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
6abce8bb4b8a2599aca0021af9e39b66c2cd77a7 conflict resolved
All men make faults, and even I in this,
Authorizing thy trespass with compare,
Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
This is william's line 10
